# HistoriKC

Welcome to HistoriKC Rails! Check out this site deployed at [http://historikc.com](https://historikc.com).

HistoriKC is an attempt to make historic photos of Kansas City more accessible. Despite our rich history and great
repositories of photos like KC Public Library's Missouri Valley Special Collections, it was still difficult to explore photos
by areas of the city.

Locations within the application are intersections pulled from OpenStreetMap. All photos are sourced from the Missouri Valley
Special Collections, and are loaded via a rake task which looks at various photo attributes to determine the nearest location.
